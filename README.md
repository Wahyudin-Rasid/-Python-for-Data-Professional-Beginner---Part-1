My Uncle's Expedition: I grabbed my cell phone on the table and opened a short message from uncle the other day explaining that uncle had to spend 1.5 million per car in a day.
However, he is always confused about the total expenses per month because of the odd-even rules that make the operation of the car different. "In that case, I'll enter the number_day variable containing the number of days in a month and the list_plat_number variable containing all of uncle's car plate numbers," I muttered to myself.
In this case, you only need to change the number_day variable or modify the list_plat_number variable to track your total expenses for a month. Nice idea!
